                    This image is a photo I took while on a trip to Taiwan to visit relatives. I chose to use this image because of the multiple elements inside it, including the train, a poster, and a walking path. Specifically, the poster is of a lantern festival because I went to the location to launch lanterns myself. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This image relates to my topic of explaining photos from places I've been as it has many components that relate to the context of where the photo was taken.

                    This image looks like a collage of the student's daily life, from studying to getting drinks and maybe even exercising.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What I find most interesting about this image is definitely the way the images are combined in a collage, and the meaning or story behind each one and how they come together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most obvious aspects of this image are who it's about (the student) as well as their drinks and clothing. I think the more mysterious or obscure aspects of the image come from the sketched on details, like the tears, hearts, or highlights.

                    10 intriguing photographs</a> was a thought provoking and creatively intriguing read about the power of photos to jog conversation and deeper critical thinking. In particular, it was interesting how the article explained how unusual photos could improve students' visual thinking and close reading skills by drawing their attentions. For my upcoming project, I'd also want to choose photos that draw people in, surprise them, and help them think and potentially make a new discovery.

                    <a href="https://www.giuligartner.com/">Guila Gartner's portfolio </a>that I found on Awwwards.com was an inspiring look at how I could make images interactive and compelling on a webpage. She interspersed images with text and often rotated them in three-dimensions to keep things interesting. Having photos move as I scrolled and shake or expand if I hovered over them was also a nice touch that made eveyrthing as a whole feel more interactive.

                    Best practices for Modals</a> was an educational and interesting read that taught me more in-depth about the use of Modals and overlays in UX design. One interesting point I read about was the importance of not surprising users with a modal window and ensuring they always have a clear escape. Especially for older or unfamiliar users, modals can be surprising and annoying so ensuring their design is human-centered is something I reaized was more important than I thought.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Something else that I didn't first think of about Modals and Overlays was taking care to pay attention to the orientation of the keyboard. I didn't think about how keyboards should interact with modal windows, so that keyboards can be used to close modal windows and they're always easily accessible when a modal window is opened. Overall, what I took away from reading the article was to be conservative and intentional with modals and overlays, and to only use them when there is a good reason.

                    Best practices for form design</a> was an interesting and also extremely helpful read on everything that goes into the design of online forms. All 20 best practices are definitely ones that I'll take note of, and many were ones that I otherwise might not have initially thought of. Especially for the Mad Libs assignment, aspects like clear labels and placeholder text could be key to creating a final product that would actually make sense.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many of the principles were fairly simple, but went in-depth enough to bring my attention to aspects of form design I wouldn't have considered. I thought the fourth principle, asking the easy questions first, was particularly interesting to me, because it made me realize forms can be thought of as a journey. You want users to progress through a form painlessly and without obstructions, and having easy questions to start with will help users warm up and allow them to be better able to answer later, more complex questions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A website form that stands out to me as exemplifying most of the best practices in the article is <a href="https://www.typeform.com/">Typeform</a>. By having smooth animations and a simple, focused aesthetic for questions, I really enjoyed the form filling process using Typeform.

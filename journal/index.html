                    Best practices for form design</a> was an interesting and also extremely helpful read on everything that goes into the design of online forms. All 20 best practices are definitely ones that I'll take note of, and many were ones that I otherwise might not have initially thought of. Especially for the Mad Libs assignment, aspects like clear labels and placeholder text could be key to creating a final product that would actually make sense.

                    Many of the principles were fairly simple, but went in-depth enough to bring my attention to aspects of form design I wouldn't have considered. I thought the fourth principle, asking the easy questions first, was particularly interesting to me, because it made me realize forms can be thought of as a journey. You want users to progress through a form painlessly and without obstructions, and having easy questions to start with will help users warm up and allow them to be better able to answer later, more complex questions.

                    A website form that stands out to me as exemplifying most of the best practices in the article is <a href="https://www.typeform.com/">Typeform</a>. By having smooth animations and a simple, focused aesthetic for questions, I really enjoyed the form filling process using Typeform.

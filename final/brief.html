    <h1>Project Brief</h1>
    <p>I plan on updating my Game On! studio project by incorporating more interactions throughout different parts of the game as well as displaying each player's score in a more creative way.</p>
    <h2>Comparison Project 1</h2>

    <p>I looked up Poker sites as I initially drew inspiration from Poker for the design of my Game On! project. Overall, I thought the site definitely looked like a game, but I thought it could look more refined and cohesive in design. The buttons are blocky and their design isn't consistent or distinctive and the chips are small and difficult to make out. However I think the arrangement of the cards is attractive and thoughtful, and the amount of money in the pot is clearly shown.</p>
    <h2>Project Goals</h2>
    <p>My goals for my update of my Game On! project are to make it look more refined in aesthetic but also animation, as well as make the design more creative. I hope to create a refined and cohesive look that I hope will look more stylized than the website I found.</p>
    <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
    <p>I plan on keeping the same overall feel but simply refining the look of everything in my game and ensuring it all feels cohesive. I hope to make type more intentional and differentiate between different information through color or font weight. I also hope to place elements and buttons more logically and space everything well.</p>
    <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
    <p>I plan on adding in more animations for when the game is loaded or reset, and maybe more interactions with the cards themselves. To be specific, I want to see if I can create an animation for flipping cards over and show a card back. Aside from that, I plan to add small animations throughout my project to make it feel more refined.</p>
    <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
    <p>I hope to create a refined and coheisve experience for users that feels like a real, tactile game rather than something clearly digital. I hope to recreate the analog feel of playing with cards and will try to incorporate additional sounds to that extent. I also plan to make all buttons unique and with relevant, logical designs that would fit in with an analog, real-life game as well.</p>

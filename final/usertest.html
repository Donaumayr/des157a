    <h1>User Test Results</h1>
    <p>The animations could be a bit snappier and quicker, specifically with cards on the sides.</p>
    <p>Highlight on which player is going is confusing, maybe make it darker or do something else.</p>
    <p>Winning isnâ€™t clear or distinctive enough, make text larger/stylistic and add sound.</p>
    <p>Placement of the Quit/New Game button should be more intentional, it feels a little randomly placed.</p>

    <h2>Plan</h2>
    <p id="body">I not only learned about potentially misleading and lacking aspects of my design, but also identified a couple bugs in my code. In my Final Project, I plan to apply changes to address all the issues that came up in user testing in order of difficulty. I also hope to expand on the ruleset I currently have in my game to differentiate it more from the base level game of Pig. Hopefully the final product will come out as a more refined version of what I have now, with more taken into consideration, as there were a lot of aspects of my project I didn't initially put as much thought into that user testing made me rethink.</p>
